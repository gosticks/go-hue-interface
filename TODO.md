# TODO

- We have to decide how we want to handle the different Versions. I'd say we only support the newest one as it seems like the old has no advantages at all.



## Clarification needed
- In the 'LightState' the 'BridgeID' should be the brightness in my opinion
- The 'LightState' in it's whole seems like a struct meant to house everything. Maybe we should create multiple LightStates for he different uses. We could also create a core Lightstate interface to keep the code clean.
